Input Parameters (from URL):
  billId: 32-character string
  rn1: 32-character string
  rn2: 32-character string
  part: used to identify interfaceID
  docId: passed but not directly used in current code

Validations:
  Length of billId, rn1, and rn2 must be exactly 32 characters
  If invalid, audit log must be written, and the process should terminate

Interface Check:
  If part is present:
    Validate part exists in EBILL_INTERFACE table as interface_id
  If invalid, log audit and terminate

Data Fetch Logic:
  If part is missing or empty:
    Look up the EAPOST_VALIDATEREDIRECTION table with billId, rn1, rn2
    Retrieve accountNumber and docId as newBillId(from flex1)
  If part is valid:
    Use EBILL_NOTIFICATION table with billId, rn1, rn2 to get accountNumber and docId as newBillId

PDF Retrieval:
  Retrieve pdfBillKey - Join BILL_MAIN and BILL_VOLUME tables using accountNumber and newBillId
  If pdfBillKey not found, log audit and terminate
  Retrieve PDF - Use CISDBManager.getInstance().getPDFBill(accountNumber, pdfBillKey) to get PDF byte stream
  If retrieval fails, log audit and terminate
